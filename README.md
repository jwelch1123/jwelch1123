## Notable Projects
1. **Fraud Detection in Medicare Claims Data** - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/detecting-the-red-flags-of-medicare-fraud/) - [Presentation](https://youtu.be/eo83e13ka94?t=1886) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/healthcare_fraud_detection)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-grey?logo=scikitlearn) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-grey?logo=pandas) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cross_Validation-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SMOTE_Upsampling-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Classification-grey)
    - Constructed a model to predict fraudulent Medicare claims with a 78% accuracy and fraudulent providers with an 87% accuracy by cross-validation and tuning of scikit-learn, XGBoost, and CatBoost models.
    - Reduced data requirements from 100+ claims to 10 while maintaining accuracy and specificity by predicting fraudulence on a claims level then aggregating up to predict provider fraud. Reducing time-to-prediction from over a year to under 2 months, allowing multiple opportunities to identify fraudulent providers.
    
2. **Interactive Database Visualization** - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/a-shiny-app-for-freezer-management/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/freezer_management)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-grey?logo=R) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shiny-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data_Visualization-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database_Management-grey)
    - Built an interactive dashboard in R-Shiny for the management of cell stocks across multiple R&D departments with integrated data visualizations and workflow-specific data capture. 
    - Interviewed Managers and Operators across departments to customize the database and visualizations and data capture to their specific needs. 

3. **Playlistr:** - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/playlistr) - [Web App](https://playlistr-1e867cea68d7.herokuapp.com/)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-gray?logo=Python) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spotify%20API-gray?logo=Spotify) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dash-grey?logo=plotly) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requests-gray)
    - Uses the Spotify API to create playlists matching a chosen message, and saves them to your Spotify account.
    - The Dash App provides two interfaces: "pick-and-choose" for manual selection and "auto-solver" for automatic playlist creation. The playlistr.py file can also be run locally but requires a Spotify App credentials.

4. **Wit, Wisdom, and Vector Embeddings** - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/wit-and-wisdom)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-grey?logo=python) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dash-grey?logo=plotly)  ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly_Express-grey?logo=plotly) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-grey?logo=scikitlearn) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SentenceTransformers-grey)
    - Applied NLP to visualize the similarity of sayings from Benjamin Franklin's *Poor Richard's Almanack*. Applied SentenceTransfomers and UMAP to vectorize and reduce the data to a graphable form. 
    - The embedded quotes are visualized in a Dash app using Plotly to allow interactions with the graph. Users can enter a new phrase to find the closest match, hover over quotes to view them and their neighbors, or highlight a region and view all quotes in the table below. 
    - Note: Due to the size of the SentenceTransformer package, the Dash app cannot be hosted on standard platforms (Heroku), view the repo for download and installation instructions. 

5. **Housing Price Analysis with Machine Learning** - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/author/james-welch/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/ames_housing)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-grey?logo=scikitlearn) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-grey?logo=pandas) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gradient_Boost-grey) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Regression-grey)
    - Achieved top 33% of scores in Ames Housing dataset Kaggle challenge, with a mean prediction error of 8% by applying multiple linear and tree models. 
    - Applied 4 linear and 3 tree-based models, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to predict home sale prices.

6. **Web Scraping for Business Analysis** - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/the-library-of-audible-web-scraping/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/finding_the_tree_in_the_forest)
    - ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-gray?logo=python) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scrapy-gray?logo=scrapy) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-grey?logo=pandas) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-grey)
