## Notable Projects
1. Fraud Detection in Medicare Claims Data - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/detecting-the-red-flags-of-medicare-fraud/) - [Presentation](https://youtu.be/eo83e13ka94?t=1886) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/healthcare_fraud_detection)
    - Constructed a model to predict fraudulent Medicare claims with a 78% accuracy and fraudulent providers with an 87% accuracy by cross-validation and tuning of scikit-learn, XGBoost, and CatBoost models.
    - Reduced data requirements from 100+ claims to 10 while maintaining accuracy and specificity by predicting fraudulence on a claims level then aggregating up to predict provider fraud. Reducing time-to-prediction from over a year to under 2 months, allowing multiple opportunities to identify fraudulent providers. 

2. Interactive Database Visualization - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/a-shiny-app-for-freezer-management/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/freezer_management)
    - Built an interactive dashboard in R-Shiny for the management of cell stocks across multiple R&D departments with integrated data visualizations and workflow-specific data capture. 
    - Interviewed Managers and Operators across departments to customize database and visualizations and data-capture to their specific needs. 

3. Housing Price Analysis with Machine Learning - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/author/james-welch/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/ames_housing)
    - Achieved top 33% of scores in Ames Housing dataset Kaggle challenge, with a mean prediction error of 8% by applying multiple linear and tree models. 
    - Applied 4 linear and 3 tree-based models, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to predict home sale prices.

4. Web Scraping for Business Analysis - [Article](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/the-library-of-audible-web-scraping/) - [Repository](https://github.com/jwelch1123/finding_the_tree_in_the_forest)
    - Scraped 250,000+ audiobooks from Audible for title and category information using Python Scrapy.
    - Suggested opportunities for growth and expansion by analyzing pricing, length, rating, and language data.
